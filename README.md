# chit-chat
A complete, better replacement of the chat system in GTA:O.  
![demo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1028029718840217620/1028030054900441098/unknown.png)
Chit-Chat hides GTA:O's chat and replaces it with a new, better, GUI-based one. Chit-Chat allows you to:  
- Mute players  
- Rate-limit the chat to prevent seeing spam  
- Change the color of literally every single thing in it  
- Conditionally coloring player names based on certain criteria (i.e whether they are a friend, a modder, or a stranger)  
- See which players are typing right above the chat box, and configure this behavior to work to your liking (ie whether to unhide chat when someone starts typing).  

If you are familiar with my script chatPlus, chit-chat is that, but much better, and without any of the flaws chatPlus had. For instance, muting players is almost creepy; you will never hear from them again.  
I am very happy to release this, but a lot of work and code was put into it, so bugs might happen. If they do, please report them so I can squash them!  
Please enjoy!
